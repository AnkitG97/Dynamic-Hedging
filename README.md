# Dynamic-Hedging

In this project, I developed a Python-based visualization tool to analyze how key risk metrics—mean, standard deviation, and expected shortfall—evolve for different options positions under varying market conditions. The study focuses on short call, short put, long call, and long put positions, examining their behavior as a function of:

Volatility changes: Impact of different levels of implied/realized volatility on hedging effectiveness.
Rebalancing frequency: The effect of adjusting hedge positions at different time intervals on portfolio risk and performance.
Using dynamic simulations, the code models the P&L distribution for each option strategy, illustrating how hedging performance changes in response to market fluctuations. The visualization aids in understanding the trade-off between hedging precision and transaction costs while highlighting risk exposure under different conditions.

This project provides insights into the practical challenges of delta hedging, helping traders assess how well they can manage option risk in volatile markets.
